# AudioSteganography
In the digital age, communication security and data privacy are of utmost importance. There is a need for an efficient method to embed secret information inside audio signals without degrading the quality of the audio. This project explores the use of Least Significant Bit (LSB) audio steganography to achieve this goal.
# Project Objectives : 
1. To implement LSB-based steganography for embedding secret text within an audio file.
2. To ensure audio quality is preserved after embedding the hidden message.
3. To successfully extract the hidden message from the modified audio.
